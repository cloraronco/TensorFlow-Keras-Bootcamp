## Introduction

TensorFlow Keras is an open-source neural network API, written in Python, and part of the TensorFlow ecosystem, a popular machine learning framework. TensorFlow Keras provides a user-friendly interface for the creation, training, and deployment of deep learning models.  

With TensorFlow Keras, developers have access to a comprehensive set of tools and functions for tasks such as designing neural network architectures, training models on large datasets, and deploying models in various applications. It simplifies the process of creating and experimenting with deep learning models, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced researchers.  

Used in various domains, TensorFlow Keras finds applications in areas such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. Its versatility makes it suitable for a range of machine learning tasks.  
  
  
Before this bootcamp, I underwent an [OpenCV Bootcamp](https://github.com/cloraronco/OpenCV-Bootcamp) . 
Each chapter contains one or more files, organized by concepts.  
Happy exploring!
